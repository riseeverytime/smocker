# Real Life Usage

In real life scenarios, we not only use the **user interface of Smocker** but also its **API**. Smocker's API offers all the primitives to orchestrate your mocking environment in a fully automated way.

At [OVHCloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com/fr/), **we use Smocker in complement of [Venom](https://github.com/ovh/venom)**, an integration testing framework. Venom provides primitives to create HTTP calls, manipulate databases and message queues, and much more. It also provides a powerful context for writing assertions.
